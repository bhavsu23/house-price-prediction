The **House Price Prediction** project uses machine learning models like Linear Regression, Random Forest, and SVM to predict prices based on features like lot area and year built. It evaluates performance using MSE and R-squared, with visualizations to compare predicted vs. actual prices.

The **House Price Prediction** project applies machine learning techniques to estimate house prices based on various features from a dataset. Key features include lot area, building type, year built, total basement area, and sale price. The dataset is carefully cleaned and preprocessed to ensure accuracy and relevance of the data before modeling.
The project implements three predictive models: **Linear Regression**, **Random Forest**, and **Support Vector Machines (SVM)**. Each algorithm is applied to forecast house prices, leveraging different aspects of the data. Linear Regression captures basic linear relationships, while Random Forest introduces non-linear predictions by combining multiple decision trees. SVM focuses on finding the optimal boundary for price predictions based on feature patterns.
The performance of these models is evaluated using metrics such as **Mean Squared Error (MSE)** and **R-squared**, providing insights into each model's accuracy and reliability. The analysis highlights the strengths and weaknesses of each approach, helping to identify the best performing model for this particular dataset.
Visualizations, such as scatter plots, are included to present the comparison between predicted and actual house prices, offering a clear visual representation of model effectiveness. These visual tools help users understand how well the models generalize on unseen data and how certain features influence price predictions.
Overall, this project demonstrates the end-to-end process of applying machine learning to real-world datasets, making it a valuable tool for understanding predictive modeling in the real estate sector.
